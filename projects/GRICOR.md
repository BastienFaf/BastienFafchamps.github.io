## Gricor
#### React and Flask School project

This web application is a group project made in school for a somewhat real client.
Our team applied AGILE methods to work on the project, analyzing the client's needs, work in sprints, etc.

This application is made for professors who wants to make tests correction faster. It works by scanning open-ended answers and distributing the corrections between multiple teachers.

I've worked on both the front and back ends, we have developed the interface using React and MaterialUI. And the back-end is in python with the Flask framework. It also uses a MySql database.

I've learned to work in a team as well as manage it and teach newcomers.
