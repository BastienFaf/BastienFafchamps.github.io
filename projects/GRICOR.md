## Gricor
#### React and Flask School project

This web application is a group project made in school for a somewhat client.
Our team applies AGILE methods to work on the project, analyzing the client's needs, working in sprints, etc.

I've worked on both the front and back ends, we have developed a somewhat advanced interface using React and MaterialUI. And the back-end is developed in python with the Flask framework. It also uses a MySql database.

I've learned to work in a team as well as managing it and teaching newcomers.
