## Town's King

##### Small web turn-based strategy game, synced in real-time using Firebase.

I wanted to change things up and tried making a game using only HTML and JavaScript. I decided to challenge myself not to use a JavaScript framework as I've had already been working a lot with React but not that much in vanilla javascript.

This project uses Firebase authentification and database listening system to build a custom **matchmaking system**. It makes heavy use of Firebase rules to secure gameplay **without the need of server logic**. All games are stored in the database and could be replayed using stored data.

CSS has been mostly done by my hand but all images of 3D models come from [this](https://www.kenney.nl/assets/hexagon-kit) awesome free asset pack made by [Kenney](https://www.kenney.nl/).
