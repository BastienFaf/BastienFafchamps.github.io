##### Small shoot them all game jam projet

A small 3D top down shoot them all, with a gun getting random range, reload speed, damage every few seconds.
Made in a week-end for the GMTK Game Jam, unfortunaly I didn't finished in time. Nothing especially out of the ordinary, the game loop is there but the difficulty was kinda off. One thing I could point out is the 3D UI for the gun. (0:45)

All code, sounds and assests were made by myself.
