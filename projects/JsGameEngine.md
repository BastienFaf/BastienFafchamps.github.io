## Tiny Engine
#### Vanilla JS tiny game engine

**JavaScript, HTML, CSS**

This web application is a project I've made solo. It's a fully featured game making environement. With code writing, pixel art and sound editing. ([Source Code](https://github.com/BastienFafchamps/JsGameEngine))

It is still work in progress but it's publicly availible, you can fiddle with it if you want. (Click the second button to (re)start a game)

It can also "compile" to a single HTML file, no extra CSS, javascript or media files required. And without using any cdns or imports. Meaning it can be downloaded and used on a pc localy, without an internet connection.

As said before, it features a complete code editor with basic syntax highlighting. The code writen by the user is then executed by the application. A bunch of functions can be call by the user allowing him to easly make a simple game.

I've decided to make it in vanilla JavaScript for multiple reasons. Firstly for the challenge, I wanted to try to write a code editor and all the other tools by myself. Secondly because I want a complete control of the application build step to be able to build everything in a single HTML file. And finaly, because I like it. I can easly work with a framework (I have experience with React, Vue and Svelte) but I like the "simplicity" of vanilla JS.
