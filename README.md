# Bastien Fafchamps Portfolio
###### This repo is the git for my portfolio hosted using Github Pages.

This portfolio was made without using any JavaScript framework but libraries used include Three.js, Anime.js, ScrollMagic, and drawdown which translates in real-time markdown files to html, used for the different projects articles.
